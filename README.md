## Objective
 This project it to create a responsive web page for my leather bags and handmade buttons. I decided on one page instead of several, as the information can be kept to one page. 
 
 The web page must include:

    * About section
    * Contact section
    * Where to buy section
    * At least one image of a bag
    * At least one image of a button
    * Links to social media
    * Links to online shops
    * Links to each section from navigation bar

 ## Initial stage
    I first created the html anc css code for a flexbox page with a header, footer and 4 ections. 
     * A section for the hero image
     * A section for About me
     * A section for Where to buy
     * A section for Contact details


 ## Design
  I wanted a simple design in black/white/grey to match the logo of used which is black and white. 
  The hero image was chosen as it is a clear image of a selection of different bags. and the button images also show a selection. I chose four buttons to fit in line underneath the bag image. 

  The about me section was added to in order to neatly line up with the images. 

## Links
 All the externl links for social media and online shops were copied directly from the url bars on the web pages i  order to ensure accuracy. 
  The contact section was added to to increase its height so as to line up with the about me section. 

## Navigation

I added navigation to the header and footer. The footer section has an extra 'Home' tab which is linked to the header to take the user back to the top of the page.

## Redesign
I remade the page using bootstrap and media query to make it responsive
